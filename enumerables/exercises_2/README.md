These are a delightful collection of exercises that will give you an opportunity to flex your enumerable skills.

The `all_enumerable-exercises_test.rb` file will require you to use _every_ enumerable listed in the `exercises_1` directory. 

It is a master class on iteration and enumerables in Ruby. 

This is a _difficult_ exercise.

As you work through it, if you find yourself particularly challenged in using a certain enumerable, consider jumping into the `exercises_1` directory and examining _in detail_ that enumerable and it's "pattern" test, implemented using `#each`.

This is a tremendous resource to help you build mastery and fluency with enumerables in Ruby. 

ðŸ¤žgood luck!
